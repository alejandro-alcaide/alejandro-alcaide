# league-multi-account-auto-login

Since I play a lot of League of Legends and I have multiple accounts spread through several servers, I figured an automated app would be fun to build. I also wanted to work a bit with JSON so my database is in such format.

Platform: Windows 10
Language: UI Path RPA
Elaboration: This UI Path RPA app retrieves and deserializes a configuration JSON file to get the "League of Legends" game client path, as well as a list of accounts to be used.

I intend to add a step to choose a valid executable game file, as well as a flow to manage the accounts (CRUD).
